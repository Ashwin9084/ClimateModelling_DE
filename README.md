# Modelling the Earth's climate using differential equations

## Abstract:
A climate model is a mathematical representation based on the study of the long-term behaviours of the climate system as it is affected by changes to various parameters. A differential equation model was developed and verified using the mean global temperature annually, forest area, and the daily amounts of precipitation. We mostly use the model used in [1] and check to see how it fits on real world data to check the effectiveness of the model described. One of our main contributions involve realising the effect of temperature on forest area and modelling the differential equation model described in [1] with our modifications. This research looks at the long-term behavior of rainfall as it is affected by changes in forest area and global warming. To best capture the effects of severe weather hazards such as drought , global temperature and forest cover are considered annually, while rainfall is considered seasonally. A differential equation model was developed and validated using the annual mean global temperature, forest area, and daily rainfall amounts.
